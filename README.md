# Digipolis starter kit for React

This starter kit makes it easy for you to create a React-based [ACPaaS UI](https://acpaas-ui.digipolis.be) app. It works best as part of the [Digipolis NodeJS starter kit](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/starter-kit_app_nodejs), but it's also possible to use it stand-alone.

## Basic usage

```sh
> npm install -g @digipolis/start-react
> cd your-app
> digipolis-start-react
```

## Advanced

### Run the starter kit without questionnaire

```sh
> digipolis-start-react --no-setup
```

Run the help command in order to see all available configuration options:

```sh
> digipolis-start-react --help
```
